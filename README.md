# SIMD Vector Library
A lightweight C++ SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) wrapper library providing a unified interface across SSE, AVX, and AVX-512 instruction sets.

## Educational
This library is primarily intended as an educational introduction to SIMD programming. It demonstrates the concepts and basic usage patterns of vectorized operations, but is not recommended for production use.
If you need a robust SIMD solution for production code, please use one of these established libraries instead, or roll your own.
